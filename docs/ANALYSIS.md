# ADiGator-embedded: implementation & math-documentation analysis

Analysis of the embeddable derivative-generation fork of ADiGator (v1.5),
covering (1) bugs, (2) optimization opportunities for embedded targets, and
(3) a path to reverse-mode differentiation. Line numbers refer to the state
of branch `claude/adigator-analysis-46lir7` (base commit `e9ffeff`).

Background used throughout: a generated derivative `y.dX` is the vector of
possible nonzeros of the *unrolled* Jacobian (size `[prod(ysize), prod(xsize)]`,
column-major linearization on both sides), ordered by ascending linear index;
`y.dX_location` has one column per dimension listed in `y.dX_size`
(see `lib/@cada/adigatorPrintOutputIndices.m` and User Guide §"Evaluating
Derivative Files"). `Gator*Data.Index*` fields hold index vectors
(`cadaindprint.m`), while `Gator*Data.Data*` fields hold **numeric value
constants used in arithmetic** (`cadamatprint.m`).

## 1. Bugs

### 1.1 Embedded pipeline (new code)

**B1 — `Data*` constants are down-cast to integers (high severity).**
`prune_adigator_mat` (`embedding/adigatorGenDerFile_embedded.m:209-216`)
down-casts *every* integer-valued, non-sparse numeric field to
`uint32`/`int32`. This is safe for `Index*` fields, but `Data*` fields are
value constants printed into arithmetic, e.g. for `y = A*x` with `A = eye(2)`
the generated code contains `cada1f1 = Gator1Data.Data1*x.f;`. After
down-casting, `uint32 * double` either errors at runtime ("Integers can only
be combined with integers of the same class, or with scalar doubles") or, in
scalar cases, silently propagates an integer class and *rounds all subsequent
derivative values*. Integer-valued constant matrices (identities, selection
matrices, +/-1 stencils) are extremely common.
*Fix:* apply the down-cast only to fields matching `Index*`
(`startsWith(idxName,"Index")`); leave `Data*` as `double`.

**B2 — `fprintf` format defect in the generated data-function header.**
`embedding/structure_to_embed_mfile.m:38` uses a format string containing a
single (unescaped) `%` and no trailing `\n`:
`'%% Auto-generated ... on %s\n% Helper file for ADiGator generated derivatives'`.
MATLAB discards everything from the invalid conversion (`'% H...'`) onward, so
the "Helper file" comment is silently dropped today — and under any
implementation that printed the remainder literally, `S = struct();` from the
next `fprintf` would be appended to a comment line, producing a broken data
function. *Fix:* escape as `%%` and terminate with `\n`.

**B3 — multi-match line deletion in the patcher is wrong.**
`embedding/adigator_patch_derivative.m:43-47`:

```matlab
for ii=1:length(idx)
    txt(idx+inc) = [];   % uses the WHOLE idx vector every iteration
    inc = inc - 1;
end
```

For a single match this works; for two or more matches the first iteration
already deletes all matched lines, and subsequent iterations delete arbitrary
*shifted* lines. Currently only one `if isempty(...); ADiGator_LoadData(); end`
block exists per file, so the bug is latent — but it will fire if the loader
guard ever appears in subfunctions. *Fix:* delete once with
`txt(idx) = []` (no loop), or index `idx(ii)+inc`.

**B4 — patcher assumes unique pattern matches.**
`adigator_patch_derivative.m:56-60`: `fidx = find_in_file(txt,patterns,1,0,'%')`
returns *all* lines containing both `'function'` and the subfunction name;
`txt(1:fidx)` then errors if more than one line matches (e.g. a subfunction
name that is a substring of another, or a comment-free line that both declares
and mentions a function). Substring matching via `contains` is fragile —
anchor on a regexp like `^\s*function\b.*\b<name>\s*\(`.

**B5 — `structout` can be undefined.**
In `prune_adigator_mat` (`adigatorGenDerFile_embedded.m:178-228`), if none of
`funnames` is a field of the loaded struct, `structout` is never assigned and
the function errors with a confusing message. Initialize `structout = struct();`.

**B6 — pruned `.mat` loses re-differentiation metadata.**
Pruning removes the `Derivative`/non-`Gator*Data` fields that
`adigatorFunctionEnd.m` saves for `DERNUMBER > 1`. Fine for runtime, but the
pruned `.mat` can no longer be used as the input of a further `adigator` call.
Worth a printed warning or a `_pruned` filename suffix.

### 1.2 Dimension handling in the Jacobian/gradient/Hessian wrappers

**B7 — vector-function Hessian row index uses `n` where the layout needs `m`
(inherited from upstream, still present).**
`util/adigatorGenHesFile.m:376` emits, for `m = numel(y) > 1`:

```matlab
xyind1 = (xind1-1)*n + yind;      % n = numel(x)
Hes = zeros(m*n, n); Hes((xind2-1)*(m*n) + xyind1) = y.dXdX;
```

The documented layout (header line 58: `size(Hes) = [m*n n]`) and the
sparsity pattern returned to the user
(`output.HessianStructure`, line 489: `HesRow = (HesLocs1(:,2)-1)*m + HesLocs1(:,1)`)
both use row `= (x1-1)*m + y`. With multiplier `n`:
- if `n > m`: the row index can exceed `m*n` → runtime "index out of bounds";
- if `n < m`: distinct `(y, x1)` pairs collide → **silently wrong Hessian**;
- only `m == n` coincidentally works.
Unaffected: the dominant scalar-objective case (`m == 1` takes the
`rowind = xind1` branch) — which is why this has survived. *Fix:* multiply by
`m`, and add a vector-output Hessian test.

**B8 — matrix-function-of-scalar Hessian branch dead/wrong (inherited,
flagged by an in-code comment but not fixed).**
`adigatorGenHesFile.m:319`: `elseif any(n == 1)` is always true inside the
`n == 1` branch, so the sparse projection (lines 322-326) is unreachable.
Worse, for a true matrix output (`r,c > 1`) line 321 emits
`Hes(y.dXdX_location) = y.dXdX;` where `y.dXdX_location` is an `nnz×2`
*subscript* matrix; MATLAB treats it as linear indices over all its elements →
wrong placement / size mismatch. *Fix:* branch on `any(ysize == 1)` (as was
done at lines 339/351) and convert subscripts with
`(loc(:,2)-1)*ysize(1) + loc(:,1)` for the matrix case.

**B9 — sparse vs. full layout inconsistency for non-scalar "gradients".**
`adigatorGenHesFile.m:453` (v1.5 change) transposes only the sparse branch:

```matlab
Grd = sparse(row,col,y.dX,m,n)';   % -> n×m  (denominator layout)
...
Grd = zeros(m,n); Grd((col-1)*m+row) = y.dX;   % full branch -> m×n
```

For a vector-valued `y` the wrapper therefore returns `n×m` or `m×n`
depending on the (size/density-dependent) sparse heuristic. It also disagrees
with `adigatorGenJacFile.m:339`, which never transposes. Decide one layout per
convention table and apply it in both branches (and only when the *gradient*
convention is requested).

**B10 — `output.JacobianStructure` wrong/erroring for remapped shapes
(inherited).**
`adigatorGenJacFile.m:276-286` remaps `dydxsize` to the matrix shape for
"scalar function of matrix variable" (`dydxsize = xsize`) and "matrix function
of scalar variable" (`dydxsize = ysize`), but line 361 still builds

```matlab
sparse(nzlocs(:,1), nzlocs(:,2), 1, dydxsize(1), dydxsize(2))
```

with `nzlocs` indexing the *unrolled* `[prod(ysize) × prod(xsize)]` Jacobian.
Column indices up to `n*m` are then placed in a matrix declared `n×m` (or row
indices up to `r*c` in `r×c`) → `sparse` errors or produces a wrong pattern.
The remapped cases need `ind2sub`-style decomposition like the wrapper body
does.

**B11 — char-comparison of `embed_mode` is brittle.**
`opts.embed_mode == 'c'` (`adigatorGenJacFile.m:337`,
`adigatorGenHesFile.m:322,378,451`) errors inside `&&` if a user sets
`embed_mode = 'classic'` (non-scalar logical). Use
`strncmpi(opts.embed_mode,'c',1)` or validate the option up front.

**B12 — option parsing lower-cases the field on the wrong side.**
`adigatorGenDerFile_embedded.m:66`, `adigatorGenJacFile.m:95`,
`adigatorGenHesFile.m:94`:

```matlab
opts.(lower(f)) = varargin{1}.(lower(f));   % RHS should be varargin{1}.(f)
```

Any option supplied with the documented upper-case spelling
(`adigatorOptions` help uses `OVERWRITE`, `EMBED_MODE`, ...) in a hand-built
struct errors with "Unrecognized field name".

**B13 — `Gfid` is never closed; the file is immediately read back.**
`adigatorGenHesFile.m:463` runs `fclose(fid)` after the
`for fid = [Gfid,Hfid]` loop, closing only `Hfid`. Upstream this was just a
handle leak, but the embedded pipeline immediately `readlines`-es and rewrites
the Grd wrapper (`adigatorGenDerFile_embedded.m`), risking a partially
flushed file. *Fix:* `fclose(Gfid); fclose(Hfid);`.

**B14 — file-name collision between gradient and Hessian modes.**
`adigatorGenDerFile_embedded('gradient',...)` produces `myfun_Grd` /
`myfun_ADiGatorGrd`; `...('hessian',...)` also produces both. Generating one
after the other silently overwrites the other's files with differently-shaped
outputs (Jac-file gradient wrapper vs. Hes-file gradient wrapper).

### 1.3 Math documentation defects

`adigatorDerivativeConventions.m` (the new conventions spec) contradicts both
itself and the implementation:

- **Jacobian section (lines 30-40):** displays the standard `m×n` Jacobian and
  the usage `Jacobian_x(f) * x` (which requires `m×n`), but states
  `size(...) = [length(x) length(f)]` = `n×m`. The implementation produces
  `m×n`. The size line is wrong (and is mislabeled `size(Gradient(f))`).
- **Hessian section (lines 17-27):** `f: Rn -> Rm` should read `f: Rn -> R`;
  `size(Gradient(f)) = [length(x) length(f)]` should read
  `size(Hessian_x(f)) = [length(x) length(x)]`.
- Line 36 typo: last Jacobian row reads `dfm/dx1 ... dfn/dxn` (`dfn` → `dfm`).
- The summary block (lines 53-58) is internally inconsistent with the
  generalization table (e.g. `any(c,r=1) & any(c,r>1) → r*c x n*m` covers the
  `r=1` row that the table assigns `c×m`/`c×n` shapes).
- The same comment blocks are pasted into `adigatorGenJacFile.m` and
  `adigatorGenHesFile.m` with the same errors; the Jac-file header
  (lines 50-58) still documents the upstream behavior and does not mention
  that with the `'Grd'` appendix a *column* gradient is returned.
- The User Guide (§ adigatorGenHesFile) never states the gradient orientation;
  upstream returned `1×n`, v1.5 returns `n×1` — a silent behavioral break for
  existing callers worth documenting prominently (fminunc/fmincon accept
  both, but user code doing `g*d` will break).

### 1.3a Core-library bug found via PR #1

**B15 — `OuterLoopMaxLenght` undefined-variable crash.**
`lib/@cada/adigatorAnalyzeForData.m:62` referenced the misspelled (and
therefore undefined) variable `OuterLoopMaxLenght` inside
`if size(ForLengths,2) < OuterLoopMaxLength`, so any transformation with
nested rolled `for` loops whose inner-loop length table is shorter than the
outer loop's maximum crashed with "Unrecognized function or variable".
Identified in (now closed) PR #1. **Fixed** along with two comment typos
referring to the nonexistent `RemoveUnneededIndices` (the function is
`RemoveUnneededData`).

### 1.4 Genuine fixes in this fork (verified, for the record)

- `cadaunarymath.m` derivative-rule corrections (`asec`, `acsc`, `asecd`,
  `acscd`, `acosh`, `asech`, and the `sind/cosd/...` family): the new forms
  are branch-correct for negative arguments (e.g.
  `d/dx asec(x) = 1/(x²√(1-1/x²)) = 1/(|x|√(x²-1))`) and the degree-mode
  factor is now correctly `π/180` *with degree-mode trig on the RHS* instead
  of `180/π` with radian trig — both upstream errors. Covered by
  `unit_tests/test_unarymath_rules.m` (finite-difference check).
- `adigatorGenJacFile` vector-function-of-scalar allocation fixed from
  `zeros(dydxsize(2),1)` (= `zeros(1,1)`) to `zeros(dydxsize(1),1)`.
- `any(ysize) == 1` → `any(ysize == 1)` (two occurrences) in
  `adigatorGenHesFile` — upstream always took the vector branch even for
  matrix-valued operands.

### 1.5 Fix disposition log

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| B1 (`Data*` down-cast) | **Fixed** — down-cast restricted to `Index*`; pruner extracted to `embedding/prune_adigator_mat.m`; pinned by `tests/unit/UPruneMatTest.m`. The fix landed together with integer/logical class preservation in `structure_to_embed_mfile.m` (salvaged from PR #1) — the two are coupled: preserving integer classes in the inline emitter without restricting the down-cast would have *extended* the corruption to inline mode. |
| B2 (format string) | **Fixed** — pinned by `tests/unit/UEmbedMfileTest.m`. |
| B5 (`structout` undefined) | **Fixed** in the extracted pruner. |
| B15 (`OuterLoopMaxLenght` crash) | **Fixed** (see §1.3a). |
| B7 (vector-output Hessian row multiplier) | **Fixed** — `(xind1-1)*m + yind` in `adigatorGenHesFile`, consistent with the documented `[m*n × n]` layout and `output.HessianStructure`. Covered by `hesVectorOutput*` in `tests/integration/IShapeMatrixTest.m`. |
| B13 (`Gfid` never closed) | **Fixed** — both wrapper fids closed in `adigatorGenHesFile`. |
| B8, B9, B10 | Open — pinned as auto-flipping `KnownIssue` cases in `tests/integration/IShapeMatrixTest.m` (the tests `assumeFail` while the documented behavior reproduces and become hard regression guards once fixed). |
| Pruner near-integer tolerance | **Fixed** — exact `isequal(A,round(A))` check (salvaged from PR #1). |
| `coder.load` path override | Optional `mat_filepath` argument added to `adigator_patch_derivative` (salvaged from PR #1, but defaulting to the file *name* so generated code stays relocatable). |
| Test hygiene | `adigator.m` now clears its transformation-state globals on exit; `updatestruct` warns on lossy type coercion (salvaged from PR #1). |
| B3, B4, B6, B11, B12, B14 | Open — to be pinned by further CI plan Phase 1/2 tests. |
| PR #1 architectural commits (direct emission + literal linidx) | Discarded — right direction (§2.1) but defective: `compute_wrapper_linidx` called with swapped size arguments at both call sites, second differentiation cannot parse `persistent`/`coder.*` statements, inline mode references a nonexistent struct level, and classic mode was left inconsistent with embed modes. To be reimplemented once TS-I-01 exists. |

## 2. Optimizing the generated code for embedded use

### 2.1 Static data (size and access cost)

1. **Precompute linear indices offline.** The wrappers emit runtime index
   arithmetic on constant data every call, e.g.
   `Jac((y.dx_location(:,2)-1)*m + y.dx_location(:,1)) = y.dx;`.
   Since `_location` is constant, fold this into a single constant linear
   index vector at generation time: `Jac(JacIdx) = y.dx;` with
   `JacIdx = coder.const(...)`. This (a) removes per-call integer arithmetic,
   (b) halves the stored index data (one column instead of 2-4), and
   (c) eliminates the entire class of multiplier bugs (B7/B8/B10) by
   construction.
2. **Down-cast only `Index*` (see B1), and go to `uint16` when
   `max(idx) < 65536`** — typical embedded problem sizes fit, halving const
   tables again.
3. **Deduplicate index tables.** ADiGator frequently emits identical index
   vectors under different `Index*` names (same overmap reused). A
   content-hash pass in `prune_adigator_mat` can alias duplicates to one
   field before `structure_to_embed_mfile` emission; with `coder.const` the
   compiler may pool them anyway, but in `'i'` (inline) mode the *source text*
   shrinks dramatically.
4. **Range-compress index literals.** `cadaindprint` already collapses
   all-ones vectors; extend the inline emitter to recognize arithmetic
   progressions and emit `uint32(a:s:b).'` instead of 17-digit literal lists.
   In inline mode each number costs ~20 source bytes; contiguous gathers
   (`1:n`) are very common.

### 2.2 Dead code (the existing TODO)

The generated `*_ADiGator*` file always computes the function value *and all
lower-order derivatives* of every intermediate. When the user only consumes
`Jac`, large parts are dead:

- The robust approach is a **backward slice over the emitted statement list**:
  during printing, ADiGator knows for each statement which variables it
  defines/uses; record that, then keep only statements in the transitive
  fan-in of the requested outputs (`y.dX`, optionally `y.f`). Doing it inside
  the printer avoids fragile text-level analysis.
- A cheap interim version (as the TODO suggests) is an iterate-to-fixpoint
  `checkcode` pass deleting lines flagged "value assigned but never used" —
  works because the generated dialect has no side effects, but it cannot
  remove partially-used struct fields.
- Note the converse too: many `cada1f*` lines *are* needed by derivative
  rules (`dydx` depends on `x`), so slicing, not wholesale stripping, is
  required.

### 2.3 Runtime allocation and memory traffic

5. **Offer a triplet/CSC output mode instead of dense projection.** The
   wrapper does `Jac = zeros(m,n)` (a full memset) plus a scatter on every
   call. Embedded consumers (PIPG-style first-order solvers, QP/NLP solvers)
   want either the nonzero vector with a constant sparsity pattern, or
   matrix-vector products. Emit alternative wrappers:
   - `[vals] = myfun_JacNz(...)` plus constant `rows/cols` (or `colptr/rowind`
     CSC) exported once — zero per-call allocation;
   - `w = myfun_JacTvp(v, ...)` computing `J'*v` / `J*v` directly from the
     nonzero vector — what gradient-based embedded solvers actually need.
6. **Peephole pass to remove no-op gather/scatter.** Sparsity-union
   ("overmap") code of the form
   `cada1td1 = zeros(k,1); cada1td1(Index) = src; ...` is an identity copy
   whenever `Index` is `1:k` and `src` has length `k` (common after the
   union stabilizes). Detectable at generation time from the index constants.
7. **Keep loops rolled (`unroll=0`) for code size**, but verify Coder
   compatibility of the rolled-loop Gator data (cell arrays indexed by loop
   counter): heterogeneous constant cells are supported by `coder.const`, but
   add a codegen smoke test (`codegen -args` in CI) per example to catch
   regressions early.

### 2.4 Pipeline hygiene

8. Close both wrapper fids (B13) before any read-back; better, have the
   generators return the text and let one writer own file IO.
9. Drop the `addpath`/`path(original_path)` dance in the generators by
   passing absolute paths to `exist`/`delete` and calling the user function
   via its handle; mutating the MATLAB path is process-global state that the
   try/catch only partially protects (e.g. `dbquit` still leaks it).
10. Stamp generated files with the adigator version + options hash so stale
    derivative/`.mat`/data-function triplets can be detected at load time —
    a real failure mode once files are committed into firmware repos.

---

## 3. A path to reverse-mode differentiation

### 3.1 Why and when

Forward mode costs O(n) passes (mitigated, but not removed, by ADiGator's
compile-time sparsity exploitation): for `f: Rn → R` with a *dense* gradient
(objectives are sums — `logsumexp`, least squares, Lagrangians), the forward
nonzero count of intermediates grows with `n`, so both code size and runtime
scale with `n`. Reverse mode computes the same gradient in O(1) function-cost
sweeps. For the embedded use case (objective gradients, `J'*v` products for
first-order solvers) this is the dominant win; Jacobians with `m ≈ n` or
strong column sparsity should stay forward.

### 3.2 Key observation: ADiGator already produces a static tape

After ADiGator's overloaded evaluation pass, the user program has been
resolved into a *linear sequence of primitive vectorized statements with
fixed sizes and precomputed constant index maps* (that is exactly what gets
printed to the derivative file). All control flow is either unrolled or
reduced to rolled `for` loops with per-iteration index tables
(`ADIGATORFORDATA`). This is precisely the "tape" a reverse sweep needs —
but available at *generation time*, so reverse mode can be emitted as static
source code with **no runtime taping and fully static memory**, which is
ideal for embedded targets.

### 3.3 Staged plan

**Stage 0 (no new mode, immediate):** for structured Jacobians use the
existing compression utilities (`adigatorColor`, `adigatorUncompressJac`)
to cut forward cost; document this as the stopgap.

**Stage 1 — persist the op list.** Extend the printing pass so every emitted
statement records `(opcode, input var ids, output var id, index-data refs,
operand sizes/sparsity)` into `ADIGATORDATA`. Most of this information is in
scope at each print site (`cadaunarymath`, `cadabinaryarraymath`, `mtimes`,
`sum`, `subsref`, `subsasgn`, `horzcat`, ...); the work is plumbing, not new
math. Gate it behind an option so normal generation is unaffected.

**Stage 2 — adjoint emitter.** Walk the op list backward and emit
`myfun_ADiGatorRGrd.m`:

- *Forward section:* re-emit only the function-value (`cada*f*`) statements
  (the slice from §2.2 gives exactly this), keeping intermediates needed by
  nonlinear adjoint rules live in fixed-size locals.
- *Elementwise unary ops:* reuse the `getdydx` rule table from
  `cadaunarymath.m` verbatim — the adjoint is `xbar += ybar .* dydx(x)`.
  (The recent rule-table fixes + `test_unarymath_rules.m` make this table a
  trusted single source of truth for both modes.)
- *Elementwise binary ops:* both partials already exist in
  `cadabinaryarraymath.m`.
- *Structural/linear ops* (`subsref`, `subsasgn`, `reshape`, `repmat`,
  `cat`, `sum`, `transpose`, sparse projection): the adjoint is the
  transposed index map, computable at generation time from the same constant
  index vectors the forward op uses — gathers become scatter-adds, `sum`
  becomes broadcast, `repmat` becomes `sum`. One care point: scatter-*add*
  with duplicate indices must be emitted as `accumarray`-style accumulation
  (or a generated loop), not plain indexed assignment; duplicates are
  detectable offline, so emit the cheap form when indices are unique.
- *Matrix ops:* `C = A*B` → `Abar += ybar*B.'`, `Bbar += A.'*ybar`;
  `mldivide` → solve with the transposed factor. These few ops cover the
  optimization-oriented examples in this repo.

**Stage 3 — control flow.** Start by supporting `UNROLL=1` only (embedded
users already favor static unrolled code); error out cleanly otherwise.
Then add rolled loops: emit `for i = N:-1:1` and index the per-iteration
tables (already stored per iteration for rolled loops) in reverse. `while`
loops stay unsupported in reverse (no static trip count — they're also a
codegen liability).

**Stage 4 — memory model.** Adjoint buffers have the same overmapped sizes as
their primal counterparts → total memory is a compile-time constant (sum of
intermediate sizes). No checkpointing machinery is needed; if code size
becomes the binding constraint, rolled loops (Stage 3) are the lever.

**Stage 5 — integration & validation.**
- New `DerType` `'gradient-reverse'` in `adigatorGenDerFile_embedded`; the
  existing pruning / `coderload` / inline post-processing applies unchanged,
  since the adjoint file consumes the same kind of `Index*`/`Data*` constants.
- Validation harness: for every example (`brownf`, `gapfun`, brachistochrone,
  `logsumexp`), assert `‖g_reverse − g_forward‖ ≤ tol` and compare against
  finite differences; add a vector-output `J'*v` check against the forward
  Jacobian. Wire into `unit_tests/`.
- Follow-up: Hessian-vector products as forward-over-reverse (differentiate
  the generated reverse file with the existing forward machinery) — gives
  `H*v` in O(1) sweeps for Newton-CG-type embedded solvers, versus the
  current forward-over-forward full Hessian.

### 3.4 Lower-risk alternative: transform the generated file

If modifying ADiGator's printer (Stage 1) is too invasive, note that the
*generated* forward file is itself a flat MATLAB program written in a tiny,
regular dialect (~30 statement shapes: elementwise ops, constant-index
gather/scatter, `mtimes`, `sum`, `zeros`, struct field moves), with all
indices constant. A small standalone source-to-source reverse transformer
over that dialect — parse each line, classify the statement shape, emit its
adjoint — achieves the same result without touching ADiGator internals, and
its restricted grammar makes it testable line-shape by line-shape. The cost
is sensitivity to the printer's textual conventions; pinning it with golden
files of generated code mitigates that.
